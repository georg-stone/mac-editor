## ðŸš§ Roadmap ðŸš§

Making a notes app is fun, but there's a lot to do! Slow and steady... and welcoming any help!

I don't have an official contributions guide, but just gonna write about where I see this going! (pretty soon, this will be a link to a page I maintain in the app!)

- Publishing - One goal of this app is to make publishing as easy as possible. Right now, I'm imagining:
  - Write the post
  - Click "share"
  - Get a link
  - ???
  - Profit. Or, a beautiful self-designed page on your website.

- Collaborative editing - Right now, all the docs are stored in SQLite. What's the best way to support a local-first, but still cloud-enabled workflow?

- Exporting - Right now, zero options. Theoretically, it should be easy to export markdown, HTML, PDF, etc.

- Note organization - A whole rabbit hole. Should we have two-layer hierarchies? I like the idea of scrivener, so that could be fun to make.

- TipTap improvements - Some bugs related to font. Help appreciated!
